Friends Snake — PWA
-------------------

Contents:
- index.html, styles.css, app.js : game frontend
- manifest.json, sw.js : PWA support
- icons/: PNG icons (192 & 512)
- assets/: avatars and audio (background music and short SFX)

How to run locally:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Serve the folder with a static server (required for service worker & PWA):
   e.g., `npx http-server` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser. You can install the PWA from the browser UI.

Notes:
- Audio is auto-played but browser policies may require user interaction first.
- This is a demo project; feel free to tweak art, music, or add multiplayer.
